Todo List Template App
----------------------
The tutorials are based on the :ref:`Template Apps <template-apps>`, which are 
pre-built frontend apps and a corresponding backend Atlas App Services app. 
When you install a template app, you have an end-to-end solution that you can 
run immediately. Each tutorial modifies the base app in one or more ways, so 
you can learn how to modify the template app to more closely meet your specific 
needs.

To get started, you'll need to install the Flexible Sync Template App for your 
preferred language and platform. For more information, see 
:ref:`<template-apps>`.
