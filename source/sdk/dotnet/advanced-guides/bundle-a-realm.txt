You might want to seed your mobile app with some initial data that will be available
to users on the initial launch of the app. To do this, you:

- Build a temporary {+realm+} app,

- Make a copy of an existing realm (with only the data you want bundled), and then 

- Bundle the :ref:`Realm file <dotnet-realm-file>` in your app's shared project. 

In your production app (the one that will use this bundled {+realm+} when first 
loading), you add a few lines of code to extract the {+realm+} and save it in the 
app data. The following sections provide more information on these steps.

.. _copy_a_realm_file:

Copy a Realm File
-----------------

1. Create a new project with the same data models as your production app. Open 
   an existing {+realm+} with the data you wish to bundle.

#. Use the 
   :dotnet-sdk:`WriteCopy() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_WriteCopy_Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_>` 
   method to make a copy of the realm to a new location and/or name. The 
   following code demonstrates this:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WriteCopy.codeblock.copy_a_realm.cs
      :language: csharp


Include the Realm File in Your Project
--------------------------------------

1. Add the copy to your production app's Xamarin project. The simplest way to do 
   this is as follows:

   a. Navigate to the path you specified for the new realm, and then drag the 
      newly-created .realm file to the shared Xamarin project in Visual Studio. 

   #. When prompted, choose :guilabel:`Copy the file to the directory`.

   #. In the shared project, right-click the realm file you just added, choose 
      :guilabel:`Build Action`, and then choose :guilabel:`EmbeddedResource`.

2. Update your code to read the realm file, which will be in your app's data 
   directory.

.. note:: Cross-Platform Compatibility

   Non-encrypted Realm files are cross-platform compatible, which is why you can 
   bundle the file in the shared project.

Extract the Realm File
----------------------
Before you deploy your app with the bundled {+realm+}, you need to add code to 
extract the {+realm+} from the embedded resources, save it to the app's data 
location, and then use this new copy in the app. The following code shows how 
you can do this during start-up of the app; note that it will only run when no 
{+realm+} file is found at the specified location:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WriteCopy.codeblock.extract_and_copy_realm.cs
   :language: csharp
