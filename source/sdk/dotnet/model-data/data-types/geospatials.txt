Geospatial data, or "geodata", specifies points and geometric objects on the Earth's 
surface. With the geodata types, you can create queries that are based on 
geography. For example, you can find coffee shops within a specified circle or 
region.

Geospatial Data Types
---------------------

.. _geopoint:

GeoPoint
~~~~~~~~
A :dotnet-sdk:`GeoPoint <reference/Realms.GeoPoint.html>` defines a specific 
location on the Earth's surface. All of the geospatial data types use ``GeoPoints`` 
to define their location. 

.. note::
   
   In any case where you use a ``GeoPoint``, you can alternatively 
   provide a tuple of doubles, where the first double is the latitude and the 
   second double is the longitude. The SDK interprets these tuples as 
   ``GeoPoints``. Examples on this page demonstrate both approaches.

.. _geocircle:

GeoCircle
~~~~~~~~~
A :dotnet-sdk:`GeoCircle <reference/Realms.GeoCircle.html>` defines a circle on 
the Earth's surface. You define a ``GeoCircle`` by providing a ``GeoPoint`` 
for the center of the circle and a :dotnet-sdk:`Distance <reference/Realms.Distance.html>` 
object to specify the radius of the circle. 

.. note::
   
   You can define a distance in kilometers, miles, degrees, or radians.

The following code shows two examples of creating a circle:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Geospatial.snippet.geocircle.cs
   :language: csharp

.. figure:: /images/geocircles.png
   :alt: Two Geocricles

.. _geopolygon:

GeoPolygon
~~~~~~~~~~
A :dotnet-sdk:`GeoPolygon <reference/Realms.GeoPolygon.html>` defines a polygon 
on the Earth's surface. Because a polygon is a closed shape, you must provide a 
minimum of 4 points: 3 points to define the polygon's shape, and a fourth to 
close the shape.

.. important::

   The fourth point in a polygon must be the same as the first point.

You can also exclude areas within a polygon by defining one or more "holes". A 
hole is another polygon whose bounds fit completely within the outer polygon. 
The following example creates 3 polygons: one is a basic polygon with 5 points, 
one is the same polygon with a single hole, and the third is the same polygon 
with two holes:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Geospatial.snippet.geopolygon.cs
   :language: csharp

.. figure:: /images/geopolygons.png
   :alt: 3 Geopolygons

.. _geobox:

GeoBox
~~~~~~
A :dotnet-sdk:`GeoBox <reference/Realms.GeoBox.html>` defines a rectangle on  
the Earth's surface. You define the rectangle by specifying the bottom left 
(southwest) corner and the top right (northeast) corner. The following example 
creates 2 boxes:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Geospatial.snippet.geobox.cs
   :language: csharp

.. figure:: /images/geopolygons.png
   :alt: 2 geoboxes
