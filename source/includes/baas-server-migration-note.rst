.. note::
   
   When working with a synced realm, you can make changes to your schema in 
   Atlas App Services and the client SDK will update the local realm file 
   automatically, without requiring a device reset. For more information on 
   making server-side schema changes and handling the differences between the 
   server-side schema and your client data model, see :ref:`<sync-schema-overview>`.
