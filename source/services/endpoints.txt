Introduction
------------
Modern applications often use multiple external services to handle
complex use cases, such as messaging, analytics, and data management. Many services 
send data by calling an HTTPS endpoint. {+service+} allows these services 
to send data through custom endpoints.

Create a New HTTPS Endpoint
===========================
To create a new endpoint, click :guilabel`HTTPS Endpoints` in the left navigation. 


Migrate a Webhook to an Endpoint
================================

You should plan to migrate your existing {+service+} webhook to HTTPS 
endpoints. You can do this through the UI, which provides a single-click, 
one-time migration, or manually.

.. note:: One-Time Migration

   Once a webhook has been migrated to an HTTPS endpoint, you can not 
   convert it back to a webhook.

      Yo, click the button, y'all.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      To use the {+service+} Command Line Interface ({+cli-bin+}), you first need 
      to install or update :ref:`to the latest version <realm-cli>`. 
      
      With the latest {+cli-bin+} installed, follow these steps:

      1. (download app)

      2. The :;:ref:`app structure<realm_app_structure>` contains an 
         ``https_endpoints`` directory that contains all of your app's 
         HTTPS endpoints.
         
         .. note:: 
        
            If you have existing webhooks, they are found in the older 
            ``http_endpoints`` (no ``s``) directory within the app structure. Be 
            sure you are working in the correct directory!
